# Good influencer
##  What is it?
Have you ever felt like "thank you so much!" is not enough for someone who constantly helps you at work?
Sometimes you have a co-worker who is passionate and encourages other co-workers which leads your project much in positive ways.
I call them good influencers and believe they deserve more.
Therefore I created this app which influencers can receive donations as Ether.
Also the influencers will receive a trophy whenever they get a donation which will permanently carved in the Blockchain and this can be a proof of great team player!
